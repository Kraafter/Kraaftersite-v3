Soo as everyone has known, I've already had two past versions of my website. The first one being absolutely barebones and unresponsive while
the next one being responsive but limited. Now don't get me wrong my past two sites had been really fun to make and I've learnt a lot while
making them.

## The 3rd Regeneration

Now, originally my 3rd iteration of my website (what you are seeing right now) was suppose to be for <https://mc.kraafter.me> (cancelled sadly) so that I can
try out Svelte before actually applicating it, but my mind decided to just start making this for v3. Soo thats what im doing.
